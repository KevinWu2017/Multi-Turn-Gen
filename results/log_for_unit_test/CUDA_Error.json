You may make the decision to replace some operators with custom CUDA kernels and leave others unchanged.

    "model_reasoning_response": "\nOkay, I need to create a custom CUDA kernel for matrix multiplication to replace the PyTorch matmul operation in the given model. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe original model uses torch.matmul for multiplying two matrices A (MxK) and B (KxN), resulting in C (MxN). The goal is to replace this with a custom CUDA kernel for better performance on an A100 GPU.\n\nFirst, I should consider how matrix multiplication is typically optimized on GPUs. The standard approach is to use shared memory to reduce global memory access. Each thread block can load tiles of A and B into shared memory, perform the multiplication there, and write the result to the output matrix.\n\nThe A100 uses the Ampere architecture, which has Tensor Cores that can accelerate matrix operations. However, since the user's example didn't use Tensor Cores, maybe I should stick with a standard CUDA kernel for now. But I should check if using Tensor Cores could be beneficial here. However, implementing Tensor Cores requires more complex code and might be beyond the scope for a straightforward replacement. Let's proceed with a standard tiled approach using shared memory.\n\nNext, I need to structure the CUDA kernel. The kernel will be launched with a grid of thread blocks. Each thread block is responsible for computing a submatrix of the output C. The block size should be chosen to fit within the GPU's resources. Common choices are 16x16 or 32x32 thread blocks. Let's go with 32x8 thread blocks for the matrix dimensions given (M=1024, K=4096, N=2048). Wait, maybe a more standard approach is better. Let's use a block size of 32x8 threads, which is a common configuration for matrix multiplication.\n\nThe kernel will load tiles of A and B into shared memory. Each thread in the block will compute one element of the output matrix. For each step in the K dimension, the threads load a portion of A and B into shared memory, wait for all threads to finish loading, then perform the multiplication for that step. This process repeats until all K steps are completed.\n\nNow, I need to handle the matrix dimensions. The tile sizes for A and B should be chosen such that they fit into the shared memory. Let's assume a tile size of 32x32 for A and B. Wait, but if the block is 32x8 threads, then the tile for A would be 32xK_tile and for B K_tile x 8. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the tile sizes based on the block dimensions. Let me think: if each thread computes C[i][j], then for each thread, it will need to load elements from A's row and B's column. The tile size for A would be blockDim.x (number of threads per row) and the tile for B would be blockDim.y (number of threads per column). Wait, maybe I should use a block size of 32x8 threads, and tile sizes of 32xK_tile for A and K_tile x 8 for B. Let's pick K_tile as 8, so that each thread block can handle 32x8 elements of C. Then, for each K step of 8, the threads load 32x8 elements from A and 8x8 elements from B. Wait, but the K dimension is 4096, which is divisible by 8. So the number of steps would be 4096 / 8 = 512 steps.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the shared memory is sufficient. Let's calculate the required shared memory. For each step, we need to store a tile of A (32x8) and a tile of B (8x8). Each float is 4 bytes. So for A: 32*8*4 = 1024 bytes. For B: 8*8*4 = 256 bytes. Total per step is 1280 bytes. Since there are two tiles (A and B), the total shared memory needed is 1280 bytes. The A100 has 164 KB of shared memory per SM, so this should be manageable.\n\nNow, the kernel code. The __global__ function will take pointers to A, B, and C, along with the dimensions M, K, N. Each thread will compute C[row][col] by accumulating the product of A's row and B's column.\n\nWait, but in CUDA, the threads are organized in a 2D grid. Let's define the block dimensions as blockDim.x = 32, blockDim.y = 8. Each thread is responsible for one element of the output matrix. The thread's (tx, ty) within the block will compute C[blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tx][blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + ty]. Wait, no, the output matrix is MxN. So the grid should be (ceil(M / blockDim.x), ceil(N / blockDim.y)). Each thread in the block computes one element of C.\n\nBut for the tiled approach, each thread will compute multiple elements (for the steps in K). Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Each thread calculates the position in C it is responsible for: (row, col) = (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tx, blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + ty).\n\n2. For each step in the K dimension (k_step from 0 to K / K_TILE - 1):\n   a. Load the corresponding tile of A into shared memory. The tile is A's row (row, k_step*K_TILE) to (row, k_step*K_TILE + K_TILE - 1).\n   b. Load the corresponding tile of B into shared memory. The tile is B's column (k_step*K_TILE, col) to (k_step*K_TILE + K_TILE - 1, col).\n   c. Synchronize threads to ensure both tiles are loaded.\n   d. Multiply the elements from A's tile and B's tile and accumulate into C's element.\n\nBut how to handle the loading of A and B? Each thread in the block will load one element from A and one from B per step. For example, in step k, thread (tx, ty) loads A[row][k*K_TILE + ty] and B[k*K_TILE + tx][col]. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices. Let me think again.\n\nIn matrix multiplication C = A * B, each element C[i][j] is the sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each k, we need to multiply A[i][k] and B[k][j], then accumulate.\n\nIn the tiled approach, we divide the K dimension into tiles of size K_TILE. For each tile, we load a block of A (A's rows i and columns k to k + K_TILE - 1) and a block of B (B's rows k to k + K_TILE - 1 and columns j). Then, each thread in the block computes the partial sum for C[i][j] by multiplying the corresponding elements in the A and B tiles.\n\nSo, for each thread (tx, ty) in the block, during step k, it will load A[i][k*K_TILE + ty] into shared memory (since ty ranges from 0 to K_TILE-1), and B[k*K_TILE + tx][j] into shared memory (since tx ranges from 0 to K_TILE-1). Then, after synchronization, each thread multiplies A_tile[tx][ty] and B_tile[tx][ty], adds to the result.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me define K_TILE as 8. Then, for each step, the thread (tx, ty) in the block (which has blockDim.x = 32, blockDim.y = 8) will load A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + ty) and B's element at (k*K_TILE + tx, col). Then, after loading, the thread will multiply A_tile[tx][ty] (which is A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + ty)) with B_tile[tx][ty] (which is B's element at (k*K_TILE + tx, col))? No, that doesn't seem right. Because B's element is at (k*K_TILE + tx, col), which is B's row index and column index. So when multiplied with A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + ty), which is A's row index and column index. But for matrix multiplication, the column index of A should match the row index of B. So in this case, the column index of A is k*K_TILE + ty, and the row index of B is k*K_TILE + tx. For these to be multiplied, they need to be the same. So tx and ty should be the same? That would mean that for each step, the thread (tx, ty) loads A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + ty) and B's element at (k*K_TILE + tx, col). Then, when tx == ty, they are multiplied. But that would only use a subset of the threads. Hmm, perhaps I need to reorganize the loading.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each thread in the block is responsible for loading one element from A and one from B per step. For example, during step k, thread (tx, ty) loads A[row][k*K_TILE + ty] and B[k*K_TILE + tx][col]. Then, after synchronization, each thread (tx, ty) multiplies A_tile[tx][ty] (which is A[row][k*K_TILE + ty]) with B_tile[tx][ty] (which is B[k*K_TILE + tx][col]). Wait, but that would multiply A's column index with B's row index. For matrix multiplication, the column index of A must equal the row index of B. So in this case, the column index of A is k*K_TILE + ty, and the row index of B is k*K_TILE + tx. For these to be multiplied, ty must equal tx. But that's not the case here. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. The correct way is that for each step, the thread (tx, ty) loads A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + tx) and B's element at (k*K_TILE + ty, col). Then, when multiplied, the tx and ty indices are swapped. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices. Let me think again.\n\nThe correct matrix multiplication is sum over k of A[i][k] * B[k][j]. So for each k in the current tile, the thread needs to get A[i][k] and B[k][j]. In the tiled approach, during each step, the k is in the range [k_start, k_start + K_TILE - 1]. So for the current step, the thread (tx, ty) in the block will load A[i][k_start + tx] and B[k_start + ty][j]. Then, multiply A[i][k_start + tx] * B[k_start + ty][j], and add to the result. But this would require that tx and ty are the same for the multiplication. Wait, no. Because for each step, the k is varying. For example, during the first step, k ranges from 0 to K_TILE-1. For each k in this range, the thread (tx, ty) would need to load A[i][k] and B[k][j]. But how to do this with threads?\n\nThis is where the tiling approach comes in. Each thread in the block will load one element from A and one from B for each step. For example, during step k, thread (tx, ty) loads A[i][k*K_TILE + tx] and B[k*K_TILE + ty][j]. Then, after synchronization, each thread (tx, ty) multiplies A_tile[tx][0] (since tx is the offset in the K_TILE) with B_tile[0][ty] (since ty is the offset in the K_TILE). Wait, no. Because for each step, the K_TILE is the same for both A and B. So during step k, the thread (tx, ty) loads A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + tx) and B's element at (k*K_TILE + ty, col). Then, after synchronization, the thread (tx, ty) will multiply A_tile[tx][0] (since tx is the offset in the K_TILE for A) with B_tile[0][ty] (since ty is the offset in the K_TILE for B). Then, accumulate this product into C[row][col]. This way, for each step, the thread (tx, ty) contributes A[row][k_start + tx] * B[k_start + ty][col] to the sum. But this would require that tx and ty are the same for the multiplication. Wait, no. Because for each step, the k is varying from k_start to k_start + K_TILE - 1. So for each step, the thread (tx, ty) is responsible for k = k_start + ty. Then, the A element is A[row][k_start + tx] and the B element is B[k_start + ty][col]. But this would require that tx and ty are the same for the multiplication. That doesn't make sense. I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look up a standard matrix multiplication CUDA kernel example. Oh right, in the tiled approach, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. For each thread in the block, it computes one element of the output tile. For each step in the K dimension, the thread loads one element from A and one from B into shared memory. Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies the corresponding elements from the shared memory tiles and accumulates the result.\n\nThe key is that for each step, the thread (tx, ty) in the block loads A's element at (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + tx, k * K_TILE + ty) and B's element at (k * K_TILE + tx, blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + ty). Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies A_tile[tx][ty] (which is A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + ty)) with B_tile[tx][ty] (which is B's element at (k*K_TILE + tx, col)). Wait, but this would multiply A's column index with B's row index. For matrix multiplication, the column index of A must equal the row index of B. So in this case, the column index of A is k*K_TILE + ty, and the row index of B is k*K_TILE + tx. For these to be multiplied, ty must equal tx. But that's not the case here. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I see the mistake. The correct way is that for each step, the thread (tx, ty) loads A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + tx) and B's element at (k*K_TILE + tx, col). Then, multiply them and accumulate. But how to do this with shared memory?\n\nWait, perhaps the shared memory tiles for A and B are transposed. For example, the shared memory for A stores a tile of A's rows, and the shared memory for B stores a tile of B's columns. Then, during the computation phase, each thread (tx, ty) multiplies A_tile[tx][ty] (A's row) with B_tile[ty][tx] (B's column). But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think again. The standard approach for matrix multiplication in CUDA is to have each thread block compute a tile of the output matrix. For each thread in the block, it computes one element of the output tile. For each step in the K dimension, the thread loads one element from A and one from B into shared memory. Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies the corresponding elements from the shared memory tiles and accumulates the result.\n\nThe key is that for each step, the thread (tx, ty) in the block loads A's element at (row, k_start + tx) and B's element at (k_start + ty, col). Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies A_tile[tx][ty] (A's element at (row, k_start + tx)) with B_tile[tx][ty] (B's element at (k_start + ty, col)). Wait, but this would multiply A's column index with B's row index. For matrix multiplication, the column index of A must equal the row index of B. So in this case, the column index of A is k_start + tx, and the row index of B is k_start + ty. For these to be multiplied, tx must equal ty. But that's not the case here. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I think I'm mixing up the indices. Let me try to reindex. Let's say that during step k, the thread (tx, ty) in the block loads A's element at (row, k*K_TILE + tx) and B's element at (k*K_TILE + ty, col). Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies A_tile[tx][0] (since tx is the offset in the K_TILE for A) with B_tile[0][ty] (since ty is the offset in the K_TILE for B). Then, accumulate this product into C[row][col]. This way, for each step, the thread (tx, ty) contributes A[row][k_start + tx] * B[k_start + ty][col] to the sum. But this would require that tx and ty are the same for the multiplication. No, because for each step, the k is varying. For example, during the first step, k=0, and tx ranges from 0 to K_TILE-1. So for each tx, the thread loads A[row][0 + tx] and B[0 + ty][col]. But how to ensure that tx and ty are the same? This is not the case. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nI think I need to refer to a standard matrix multiplication CUDA kernel example. Let me recall that in the tiled approach, each thread block computes a tile of the output matrix. For each thread in the block, it computes one element of the output tile. For each step in the K dimension, the thread loads one element from A and one from B into shared memory. Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies the corresponding elements from the shared memory tiles and accumulates the result.\n\nThe correct way is that for each step, the thread (tx, ty) in the block loads A's element at (row, k_start + tx) and B's element at (k_start + ty, col). Then, after synchronization, the thread multiplies A_tile[tx][ty] (A's element at (row, k_start + tx)) with B_tile[tx][ty] (B's element at (k_start + ty, col)). Wait, but this would multiply A's column index with B's row index. For matrix multiplication, the column index of A must equal the row index of B. So in this case, the column index of A is k_start + tx, and the row index of B is k_start + ty. For these to be multiplied, tx must equal ty. But that's not the case here. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, I think I'm making a mistake in how the shared memory is accessed. Let me think again. The shared memory for A stores a tile of A's rows, and the shared memory for B stores a tile of B's columns. For example, the shared memory for A is of size blockDim.x (rows) x K_TILE (columns), and the shared memory for B is of size K_TILE (rows) x blockDim.y (columns). Then, during the computation phase, each thread (tx, ty) in the block multiplies A_tile[tx][k] (A's element at (row, k_start + k)) with B_tile[k][ty] (B's element at (k_start + k, col)), for k from 0 to K_TILE-1. The sum over k gives the contribution for this step.\n\nSo, during the loading phase, for each step, the thread (tx, ty) loads A's element at (row, k_start + ty) into A_tile[tx][ty], and B's element at (k_start + tx, col) into B_tile[tx][ty]. Then, after synchronization, the thread (tx, ty) multiplies A_tile[tx][k] with B_tile[k][ty] for each k, and accumulates the result.\n\nWait, but how to do this in code? The standard approach is to have a loop over the K dimension in steps of K_TILE. For each step, the thread loads the corresponding elements from A and B into shared memory, then performs the multiplication.\n\nLet me outline the code for the kernel:\n\n__global__ void matrixMulKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int M, int K, int N) {\n    __shared__ float As[32][8];\n    __shared__ float Bs[8][32];\n\n    int bx = blockIdx.x;\n    int by = blockIdx.y;\n    int tx = threadIdx.x;\n    int ty = threadIdx.y;\n\n    int row = bx * 32 + tx; // C's row\n    int col = by * 8 + ty;  // C's column\n\n    float Cvalue = 0.0;\n\n    for (int k = 0; k < (K / 8); ++k) {\n        // Load A and B into shared memory\n        As[tx][ty] = A[row * K + k * 8 + ty];\n        Bs[tx][ty] = B[(k * 8 + tx) * N + col];\n\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        // Multiply and accumulate\n        for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {\n            Cvalue += As[tx][i] * Bs[i][ty];\n        }\n\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n\n    C[row * N + col] = Cvalue;\n}\n\nWait, but this code has a problem. The As and Bs arrays are declared as [32][8] and [8][32], respectively. The thread (tx, ty) loads A's element at row * K + k*8 + ty, which is A's row (row) and column (k*8 + ty). Similarly, B's element is at (k*8 + tx) * N + col, which is B's row (k*8 + tx) and column (col). Then, during the multiply phase, the thread (tx, ty) multiplies As[tx][i] (A's element at (tx, i)) with Bs[i][ty] (B's element at (i, ty)), and accumulates. This way, for each i, the product is A[row][k*8 + i] * B[k*8 + i][col], which is correct for matrix multiplication. The sum over i gives the contribution for this step.\n\nYes, this makes sense. The As array is a tile of A's rows (32 rows) and 8 columns (K_TILE=8). The Bs array is a tile of B's rows (8 rows) and 32 columns (N_TILE=8). Each thread (tx, ty) in the block loads one element from A and one from B. Then, during the multiply phase, the thread (tx, ty) multiplies the elements from As[tx][i] and Bs[i][ty], which corresponds to A's element at (row, k*8 + i) and B's element at (k*8 + i, col). The sum over i gives the contribution for this step.\n\nThis approach should work. Now, the block dimensions are 32x8 threads. The grid dimensions are (ceil(M / 32), ceil(N / 8)). Each thread computes one element of the output matrix.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in CUDA code. Also, I need to handle the case where M, K, or N are not multiples of the block dimensions. However, since the given problem has M=1024, K=4096, N=2048, which are all multiples of 32 and 8, padding may not be necessary. But to make the code general, perhaps I should add checks to avoid out-of-bounds access.\n\nIn the kernel, after computing row and col, we should check if row < M and col < N before accessing A and B. Otherwise, the thread does nothing.\n\nSo, the kernel code would look like this:\n\n__global__ void matrixMulKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int M, int K, int N) {\n    __shared__ float As[32][8];\n    __shared__ float Bs[8][32];\n\n    int bx = blockIdx.x;\n    int by = blockIdx.y;\n    int tx = threadIdx.x;\n    int ty = threadIdx.y;\n\n    int row = bx * 32 + tx;\n    int col = by * 8 + ty;\n\n    float Cvalue = 0.0;\n\n    for (int k = 0; k < (K / 8); ++k) {\n        if (row < M && (k * 8 + ty) < K) {\n            As[tx][ty] = A[row * K + k * 8 + ty];\n        }\n        if (col < N && (k * 8 + tx) < K) {\n            Bs[tx][ty] = B[(k * 8 + tx) * N + col];\n        }\n        __syncthreads();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i) {\n            Cvalue += As[tx][i] * Bs[i][ty];\n        }\n\n        __syncthreads();\n    }\n\n    if (row < M && col < N) {\n        C[row * N + col] = Cvalue;\n    }\n}\n\nWait, but the K_TILE is 8, so K must be divisible by 8. In the given problem, K=4096, which is divisible by 8. So the loop runs K / 8 = 512 times.\n\nNow, the host code (in the PyTorch extension) needs to launch this kernel with the appropriate grid and block dimensions. The block dimensions are (32, 8), and the grid dimensions are (ceil(M / 32), ceil(N / 8)).\n\nIn the PyTorch C++ code, the function elementwise_add_cuda is replaced with matrixMul_cuda. The function will take the input tensors A and B, create the output tensor C, and launch the kernel.\n\nNow, I need to write the C++ code for the PyTorch extension. The code will include the kernel, define the function, and handle the input and output tensors.\n\nThe C++ code will look like this:\n\n#include <torch/extension.h>\n#include <cuda_runtime.h>\n\n__global__ void matrixMulKernel(float* A, float* B, float* C, int M, int K, int N) {\n    // ... as above ...\n}\n\ntorch::Tensor matrixMul_cuda(torch::Tensor A, torch::Tensor B) {\n    int M = A.size(0);\n    int K = A.size(1);\n    int N = B.size(1);\n\n    auto C = torch::zeros({M, N}, A.options());\n\n    int threads_per_block_x = 32;\n    int threads_per_block_y = 8;\n    dim3 threads(threads_per_block_x, threads_per_block_y);\n    dim3 blocks((M + threads_per_block_x - 1) / threads_per_block_x,\n                (N + threads_per_block_y - 1) / threads_per_block_y);\n\n    matrixMulKernel<<<blocks, threads>>>(A.data_ptr<float>(), B.data_ptr<float>(), C.data_ptr<float>(), M, K, N);\n\n    return C;\n}\n\nThen, in the Python code, we use load_inline to compile this code and create the function.\n\nPutting it all together, the Python code will define the ModelNew class that uses the custom CUDA kernel.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that the code is correct and compiles. Also, the kernel must handle the given matrix dimensions correctly.\n\nPotential issues to check:\n\n- The kernel uses 32x8 threads per block. The maximum number of threads per block on A100 is 1024, which is satisfied (32*8=256).\n- The shared memory usage: As is 32*8*4 = 1024 bytes, Bs is 8*32*4 = 1024 bytes. Total 2048 bytes per block. The A100 has 164 KB per SM, so this is acceptable.\n- The loop over K_TILE=8 steps. Since K=4096, the loop runs 4096/8=512 times.\n- The indexing in the kernel is correct for row-major order.\n\nNow, I'll write the complete code for the ModelNew class with the custom CUDA kernel.\n",
